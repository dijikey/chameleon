# Iced Lua Theme Builder

A powerful and flexible framework for creating dynamic themes for [Iced](https://github.com/iced-rs/iced) applications using the Lua scripting language. Separate your application's style from its logic and enable runtime theme customization without recompilation.

## ✨ Features

- **Lua-Powered Theming**: Define your Iced application's visual style using simple and expressive Lua scripts.
- **Hot-Reloading**: Change your application's theme on the fly without restarting.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Keep your Rust business logic clean and your UI styling separate.
- **Comprehensive Styling**: Style all core Iced widgets (`Button`, `TextInput`, `Slider`, `Container`, etc.).
- **Type-Safe Bridge**: Enjoy a safe interaction between Lua and Rust with proper error handling.
